Could we possibly go back to what I said about bullying? Never mind.,IncreaseHappinessExercise, ,\\n\" What I mean is that my teacher is a very important person to me. I love her, and dream of getting comfort and love from her in return. I care about my teacher. I love my teacher more than I love my own parents. My teacher is the most important person to me, and when I have a problem I generally look to them for clarity rather than to my parents. My mother and I can manage. We arent exactly close, but we dont dislike one another. My father doesnt like me. In his eyes, Im not good enough and I cant do anything write. He calls me a useless piece of shit a lot of the time, and he tends to throw things off shelves and break things in my room. He hits me sometimes, but not regularly. He mostly just shouts. I don I think I don\\'t get along with him because I can never have a proper conversation with him without him shouting at me. If I make even the slightest mistake, he starts calling me useless.

When my sister was going through something like I\\'m going through, she talked to her. I wanna feel wanted by my mother just once. And I don\\'t know what to do about it.\",StopAnxietyExercise, ,\\n\" The thing is that when I felt cold from him, I talked to him because I didnt want to end our friendship. He just answered that everything was okay and nothing has changed. Also, another problem is that I cant actually talk about something serious because Im scared. I feel very anxious during those conversations. I also think that I cant talk about such things because Im scared to offend another person. I guess youre right. I am a little nervous about this sort of topic. This sort of topics always make me feel this way.\",CalmDownExercise, ,\\n\" I lost one of my close friends due to some drama.

And I don\\'t know what to do about it.\",StopAnxietyExercise, ,\\n\" The thing is that when I felt cold from him, I talked to him because I didnt want to end our friendship. He just answered that everything was okay and nothing has changed. Also, another problem is that I cant actually talk about something serious because Im scared. I feel very anxious during those conversations. I also think that I cant talk about such things because Im scared to offend another person. I guess youre right.
